      <h2>Collaborative Leadership</h2>
      <p>Clifton Strengths Test Results (2019):</p>
      <ol class="portfolio-item-individual__list">
        <li>Strategic</li>
        <li>Achiever</li>
        <li>Discipline</li>
        <li>Futuristic</li>
        <li>Relator</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Strategic:</b></p>
      <p>"People exceptionally talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues." - <i>CliftonStrengths</i></p>
      <p>Now this is something that I've seen in myself for a while. As someone who is obsessed with assessing possibilities and optimizing environments, I'm constantly considering alternatives. For me, this means that I'm not satisfied with the minimum. However, it also means that I get caught in "the grass is always greener" mentality. When I'm at my best Strategic self, I sit in a balance between the two side of the spectrum.</p>
      <p><b>Achiever:</b></p>
      <p>"People exceptionally talented in the Achiever theme work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. They take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive." - <i>CliftonStrengths</i></p>
      <p>Whether it is a Saturday afternoon of cleaning or a heavy load of CS classes, I take a lot of pride being busy and getting stuff done. This comes with the possibility of burnout though. This past year, I met regularly with my counselor and dissected how to find a balance. As of 2020, I have, but of course I'm not perfect, and sometimes I bite off more than I can chew.</p>
      <p>Specifically, I've had to find this balance with my foreign language learning endeavors. As someone who <i>loves</i> learning languages, it killed me to think that learning 4 languages at once is just too much! I was overloading myself in my attempt to get lots done, but it cost me big time. Figuring out this balance has been an interesting transition.</p>
      <p><b>Discipline:</b></p>
      <p>"People exceptionally talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create." - <i>CliftonStrengths</i></p>
      <p>This is a theme that I feel like I used to see in myself a lot more than I do now. I don't know whether this theme would come up again if I took the assessment in 2020. However, this at least has been a very prominent theme for me as of 2019. This past year, I've been working hard to be more flexible and fun at the expense of some parts of my disciplined personality. But, as I've said before, I'm finding the <i>balance.</i></p>
      <p><b>Futuristic:</b></p>
      <p>"People exceptionally talented in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They energize others with their visions of the future." - <i>CliftonStrengths</i></p>
      <p>When I went to Disney World for the first time in 2005, dreaming about what could be has driven me to crazy extents. For example, in 2016 after visiting my brother in metro Atlanta and loving it, I was inspired by the vision of my family and I starting a new chapter in this previously unfamiliar area. By June 2017, we were packing a moving truck, ready to depart my hometown of Scranton, PA and start a new life in metro Atlanta. I won't say that I was solely responsible for our move, but I'm proud to say that I was the one who inspired the dream.</p>
      <p><b>Relator:</b></p>
      <p>"People exceptionally talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal." - <i>CliftonStrenghts</i></p>
