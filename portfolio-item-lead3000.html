      <h2>Rethinking Community Leadership</h2>
      <h3>Georgia Southern University course and third tier of the Southern Leaders Program</h3>
      <p>Personal Philosophy for Leading Positive Change:</p>
      <p>Leadership is no longer defined by the amount of change one can bring to their organization, rather by the positive change they can initiate and inspire. There is an important distinction between change and positive change, which may seem obvious, but can be unintuitive. What’s the point of founding and leading a food drive in a wealthy community? Even though it is considered leading change, it isn’t a positive change. On the opposite end of the spectrum, what would be the point of trying to implement culture changes in “underdeveloped” communities without first learning what has worked from them?</p>
      <p>This is where intent must be replaced by direct impact. Unknowingly, leaders have caused a lot of damage because of their intentions without focusing on their impact. One thing that resonated with me about this was the story of Ernesto Sirolli who talked about his organization that sought to teach African communities how to become stable through agriculture. Wondering why agriculture wasn’t a part of this community, the Italian organization taught about planting and harvesting Italian staple crops. By the time harvest came, the plants were engulfed by the enormous appetites of the local hippos. Sirolli was baffled and said, “How come you never told us about the hippos?” to which one of the locals said, “You never asked.”</p>
      <p>Though Sirolli and his crew had the intentions, they also lacked the adaptability that is required to have a positive impact. He later noted that if he had just learned from the locals, or “shut up and listen,” he could’ve really done some great work to actually create a lasting impact. Adaptivity is something that needs to be learned and perfected in order to be a good leader. This means changing beliefs, priorities, habits, etc. in order to best address the problem at hand.</p>
      <p>Also recognizing one’s own level of power and identity can help to bolster the confidence of a leader and also increase their understanding of others on their team. In the case of Sirolli’s example, he could have reflected on his own power and identity and thought about what that might mean to the members of a remote African community. As an Italian and European, he had more “power,” and he would not have shared the same experiences growing up in such a different region. This reflection of identities and power (or maybe lack of) gives leaders like us the chance to understand how their team can perceive us and how we can better understand our team.</p>
